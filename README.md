# Bostad Bot

I had trouble finding accommodation after I got accepted into university. So I made a bot that would continuously check for new listings (these particular apartments were first-come-first-served).

When a new listing was found, it would send me a notification using the [Pushbullet API](https://docs.pushbullet.com/). I had configured my phone so that it would play the notification sound on the highest volume regardless of the current "do not disturb" state.
